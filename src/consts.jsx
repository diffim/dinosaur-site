      Stegosaurus (/ˌstɛɡəˈsɔːrəs/; lit. &#39;roof-lizard&#39;) is a genus of
      herbivorous, four-legged, armored dinosaur from the Late Jurassic,
      characterized by the distinctive kite-shaped upright plates along their
      backs and spikes on their tails. Fossils of the genus have been found in
      the western United States and in Portugal, where they are found in
      Kimmeridgian- to early Tithonian-aged strata, dating to between 155 and
      145 million years ago. Of the species that have been classified in the
      upper Morrison Formation of the western US, only three are universally
      recognized: S. stenops, S. ungulatus and S. sulcatus. The remains of over
      80 individual animals of this genus have been found. Stegosaurus would
      have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus, Diplodocus,
      Brachiosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Allosaurus; the latter two may have
      preyed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs,
      short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to
      their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped
      with spikes, Stegosaurus is one of the most recognizable kinds of
      dinosaurs. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the
      subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally
      agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against
      predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display,
      and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions. Stegosaurus had a
      relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio. It had a short neck and a small
      head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species,
      Stegosaurus ungulatus, is one of the largest known of all the
      stegosaurians, reaching 7 metres (23 ft) in length and 3.8 metric tons
      (4.2 short tons) in body mass, and some specimens indicate an even larger
      body size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stegosaurus remains were first identified during the &quot;Bone Wars&quot;
      by Othniel Charles Marsh at Dinosaur Ridge National Landmark. The first
      known skeletons were fragmentary and the bones were scattered, and it
      would be many years before the true appearance of these animals, including
      their posture and plate arrangement, became well understood. Despite its
      popularity in books and film, mounted skeletons of Stegosaurus did not
      become a staple of major natural history museums until the mid-20th
      century, and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from
      several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons.
      Stegosaurus is one of the better-known dinosaurs, and has been featured in
      film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.

      Triceratops (/traɪˈsɛrətɒps/ try-SERR-ə-tops; lit. &#39;three-horned
      face&#39;) is a genus of herbivorous chasmosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur
      that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late
      Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago in what is now North
      America. It is one of the last-known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became
      extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
      The name Triceratops, which literally means &#39;three-horned face&#39;,
      is derived from the Greek words trí- (τρί-) meaning &#39;three&#39;, kéras
      (κέρας) meaning &#39;horn&#39;, and ṓps (ὤψ) meaning &#39;face&#39;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bearing a large bony frill, three horns on the skull, and a large
      four-legged body, exhibiting convergent evolution with rhinoceroses and
      bovines, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and
      the most well-known ceratopsid. It was also one of the largest, up to 8–9
      metres (26–30 ft) long and 5–9 metric tons (5.5–9.9 short tons) in body
      mass. It shared the landscape with and was most likely preyed upon by
      Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that two adults did battle in the
      fanciful manner often depicted in museum displays and popular images. The
      functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head
      have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as
      defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it
      probable that these features were primarily used in species
      identification, courtship, and dominance display, much like the antlers
      and horns of modern ungulates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triceratops was traditionally placed within the &quot;short-frilled&quot;
      ceratopsids, but modern cladistic studies show it to be a member of the
      Chasmosaurinae which usually have long frills. Two species, T. horridus
      and T. prorsus, are considered valid today, from the seventeen species
      that have ever been named. Research published in 2010 concluded that the
      contemporaneous Torosaurus, a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate
      genus, represents Triceratops in its mature form. This view has been
      disputed; further data is needed to settle the debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triceratops has been documented by numerous remains collected since the
      genus was first described in 1889 by American paleontologist Othniel
      Charles Marsh. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult
      have been found. As the archetypal ceratopsid, Triceratops is one of the
      most popular dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and
      many other types of media.

      Tyrannosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The species
      Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning &quot;king&quot; in Latin), often called T.
      rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods.
      Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what
      was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much
      wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of
      rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous
      period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the
      tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the
      Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a
      massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and
      powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but
      unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The
      most complete specimen measures up to 12.3–12.4 m (40.4–40.7 ft) in
      length; however, according to most modern estimates, T. rex could grow to
      lengths of over 12.4 m (40.7 ft), up to 3.66–3.96 m (12–13 ft) tall at the
      hips, and 8.87 metric tons (9.78 short tons) in body mass. Although other
      theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among
      the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the
      strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest
      carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex
      predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like
      ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have
      suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether
      Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the
      longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that
      Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include some that are nearly complete
      skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of
      these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant
      research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and
      biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and potential speed of
      Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also
      controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to
      be a second Tyrannosaurus species, while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a
      separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have
      also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the best-known
      dinosaurs since the early 20th century and has been featured in film,
      advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.

      Velociraptor (/vəˌlɒsɪˈræptər, vəˈlɒsɪræptər/; lit. &#39;swift thief&#39;)
      is a genus of small dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia during the
      Late Cretaceous epoch, about 75 million to 71 million years ago. Two
      species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in
      the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species
      have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation, Mongolia. A second
      species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from the Bayan
      Mandahu Formation, China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator,
      Velociraptor was about 1.5–2.07 m (4.9–6.8 ft) long with a body mass
      between 15–18.3 kg (33–40 lb). It nevertheless shared many of the same
      anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long
      tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought
      to have been used to tackle and restrain prey. Velociraptor can be
      distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an
      upturned snout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Velociraptor (commonly referred to as &quot;raptor&quot;) is one of the
      dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent
      role in the Jurassic Park films. In real life, however, Velociraptor was
      roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the approximately
      2 m (6.6 ft) tall and 90 kg (200 lb) reptiles seen in the novels and films
      (which were based on members of the related genus Deinonychus). Today,
      Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen described
      fossil skeletons, the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous
      specimen preserves a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops.

      Spinosaurus (/ˌspɪnəˈsɔːrəs/; lit. &#39;spine lizard&#39;) is a genus of
      spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what now is North Africa during the
      Cenomanian to upper Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period, about
      99 to 93.5 million years ago. The genus was known first from Egyptian
      remains discovered in 1912 and described by German palaeontologist Ernst
      Stromer in 1915. The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but
      additional material came to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear
      whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the
      scientific literature. The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from
      Egypt, although a potential second species, S. maroccanus, has been
      recovered from Morocco. The contemporary spinosaurid genus
      Sigilmassasaurus has also been synonymized by some authors with S.
      aegyptiacus, though other researchers propose it to be a distinct taxon.
      Another possible junior synonym is Oxalaia from the Alcântara Formation in
      Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinosaurus is the longest known terrestrial carnivore; other large
      carnivores comparable to Spinosaurus include theropods such as
      Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus. The most recent
      study suggests that previous body size estimates are overestimated, and
      that S. aegyptiacus reached 14 metres (46 ft) in length and 7.4 metric
      tons (8.2 short tons) in body mass. The skull of Spinosaurus was long,
      low, and narrow, similar to that of a modern crocodilian, and bore
      straight conical teeth with no serrations. It would have had large, robust
      forelimbs bearing three-fingered hands, with an enlarged claw on the first
      digit. The distinctive neural spines of Spinosaurus, which were long
      extensions of the vertebrae (or backbones), grew to at least 1.65 meters
      (5.4 ft) long and were likely to have had skin connecting them, forming a
      sail-like structure, although some authors have suggested that the spines
      were covered in fat and formed a hump. The hip bones of Spinosaurus were
      reduced, and the legs were very short in proportion to the body. Its long
      and narrow tail was deepened by tall, thin neural spines and elongated
      chevrons, forming a flexible fin or paddle-like structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinosaurus is known to have eaten fish, and most scientists believe that
      it hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey. Evidence suggests that it was
      highly semiaquatic, and lived both on land and in water much like modern
      crocodilians do. Spinosaurus&#39;s leg bones had osteosclerosis (high bone
      density), allowing for better buoyancy control, and the paddle-like tail
      was likely used for underwater propulsion. Multiple functions have been
      put forward for the dorsal sail, including thermoregulation and display;
      either to intimidate rivals or attract mates. It lived in a humid
      environment of tidal flats and mangrove forests alongside many other
      dinosaurs, as well as fish, crocodylomorphs, lizards, turtles, pterosaurs,
      and plesiosaurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six main partial specimens of Spinosaurus have been described. BSP 1912
      VIII 19, described by Stromer in 1915 from the Bahariya Formation, was the
      holotype. The material consisted of the following items, most of which
      were incomplete: right and left dentaries and splenials from the lower jaw
      measuring 75 centimeters (30 in) long; a straight piece of the left
      maxilla that was described but not drawn; 20 teeth; 2 cervical vertebrae;
      7 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; 3 sacral vertebrae; 1 caudal vertebra; 4
      thoracic ribs; and gastralia. Of the nine neural spines whose heights are
      given, the longest (&quot;i,&quot; associated with a dorsal vertebra) was
      1.65 meters (5.4 ft) in length. Stromer claimed that the specimen was from
      the early Cenomanian, about 97 million years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was destroyed in World War II, specifically &quot;during the night of
      24/25 April 1944 in a British bombing raid of Munich&quot; that severely
      damaged the building housing the Paläontologisches Museum München
      (Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology). However, detailed drawings
      and descriptions of the specimen remain. Stromer&#39;s son donated
      Stromer&#39;s archives to the Paläontologische Staatssammlung München in
      1995, and Smith and colleagues analysed two photographs of the Spinosaurus
      holotype specimen BSP 1912 VIII 19 discovered in the archives in 2000. On
      the basis of a photograph of the lower jaw and a photograph of the entire
      specimen as mounted, Smith concluded that Stromer&#39;s original 1915
      drawings were slightly inaccurate. In 2003, Oliver Rauhut suggested that
      Stromer&#39;s Spinosaurus holotype was a chimera, composed of vertebrae
      and neural spines from a carcharodontosaurid similar to Acrocanthosaurus
      and a dentary from Baryonyx or Suchomimus. The analysis was rejected in at
      least one subsequent paper.

      NMC 50791, held by the Canadian Museum of Nature, is a mid-cervical
      vertebra which is 19.5 centimeters (7.7 in) long from the Kem Kem Beds of
      Morocco. It is the holotype of Spinosaurus maroccanus, as described by
      Russell in 1996. Other specimens referred to S. maroccanus in the same
      paper were two other mid-cervical vertebrae (NMC 41768 and NMC 50790), an
      anterior dentary fragment (NMC 50832), a mid-dentary fragment (NMC 50833),
      and an anterior dorsal neural arch (NMC 50813). Russell stated that
      &quot;only general locality information could be provided&quot; for the
      specimen, and therefore it could be dated only &quot;possibly&quot; to the
      Albian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specimen MNHN SAM 124 of S. maroccanus, Muséum National d&#39;Histoire
      Naturelle, Paris MNHN SAM 124, housed at the Muséum National
      d&#39;Histoire Naturelle, is a snout (consisting of partial premaxillae,
      partial maxillae, vomers, and a dentary fragment). Described by Taquet and
      Russell in 1998, the specimen is 13.4 to 13.6 centimeters (5.3–5.4 in) in
      width; no length was stated. The specimen was located in Algeria, and
      &quot;is of Albian age.&quot; Taquet and Russell believed that the
      specimen, along with a premaxilla fragment (SAM 125), two cervical
      vertebrae (SAM 126–127), and a dorsal neural arch (SAM 128), belonged to
      S. maroccanus.
    </p>
    <p>
      BM231 (in the collection of the Office National des Mines, Tunis) was
      described by Buffetaut and Ouaja in 2002. It consists of a partial
      anterior dentary 11.5 centimeters (4.5 in) in length from an early Albian
      stratum of the Chenini Formation of Tunisia. The dentary fragment, which
      included four alveoli and two partial teeth, was &quot;extremely
      similar&quot; to existing material of S. aegyptiacus.

    <p>
      UCPC-2 in the University of Chicago Paleontological Collection consists
      mainly of two narrow connected nasals with a fluted (ridged) crest from
      the region between the eyes. The specimen, which is 18.0 centimeters (7.1
      in) long, was located in an early Cenomanian part of the Moroccan Kem Kem
      Beds in 1996 and described in the scientific literature in 2005 by
      Cristiano Dal Sasso of the Civic Natural History Museum in Milan and
      colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specimen MSNM V4047 of S. aegyptiacus in the Civic Natural History Museum,
      Milan MSNM V4047 (in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano), described by
      Dal Sasso and colleagues in 2005, consists of a snout (premaxillae,
      partial maxillae, and partial nasals) 98.8 centimeters (38.9 in) long from
      the Kem Kem Beds. Like UCPC-2, it is thought to have come from the early
      Cenomanian. Arden and colleagues in 2018 tentatively assigned this
      specimen to Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis given its size. However, this
      assignment was later rejected by other researchers who considered the
      uniqueness of this specimen to be based on misinterpretations and poor
      preservation of another specimen, NHMUK R16665, another snout stored that
      is stored in the Natural History Museum, London.
    </p>
    <p>
      FSAC-KK 11888 is a partial subadult skeleton recovered from the Kem Kem
      beds of North Africa. Described by Ibrahim and colleagues (2014) and
      designated as the neotype specimen (although Evers and colleagues 2015
      reject the neotype designation for FSAC-KK-11888). It includes cervical
      vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, neural spines, a complete sacrum, femora,
      tibiae, pedal phalanges, caudal vertebra, several dorsal ribs, and
      fragments of the skull. The body proportions of the specimen have been
      debated, as the hind limbs are disproportionately shorter in the specimen
      than in previous reconstructions. However, it has been demonstrated by
      multiple paleontologists that the specimen is not a chimera, and is indeed
      a specimen of Spinosaurus that suggests that the animal had much smaller
      hind limbs than previously thought.
